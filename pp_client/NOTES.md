- ## possible updated pen change workflow

  4. pen list
     - click on pen in list
     - a preview of the pen-path appears (speed diagram only by activating with i.e. a checkbox)
     - arrows for pen adjustments appear
     - continue button (=reste here)
  5. plot position
     - a slider (+input) for the start position appears (to continue i.e. aborted plots)
     - plot button appers (= reset here + execute plot)

PROCESS:

- ## in pp_oldmap svg
  - rename water and river_tx pens to w018
  - 1. draw p013 with 0.25 brown pen -> keep for later usage
  - 2. draw w018 with 0.18 pen (blue ink) -> clean 0.18 pen for black use afterwards
  - 3. draw p025 with 0.25 pen -> clean
  - 4. draw p018 with 0.18 pen -> clean
  - 5. draw p035 with 0.35 pen -> clean
  - 6. draw p050 with 0.50 pen -> clean

TBD:

OK merge paths that are close enough (aka pen diameter) to eliminate pen-up -> no-move -> pen-down movements
OK output scale / simplify tolerance

- visual display of scale
- ui-controls for scale(or output-dim respectively)
- ui-controls for simplification
- data-structures to have original data and the ability to change ui on the fly

OK acceleration-calculation / acceleration diagram

OK connect preview and chart so that mouseover on either element visually indicates the same assets in the other element

OK speed indication on preview
