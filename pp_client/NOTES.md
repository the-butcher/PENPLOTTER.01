TBD:

- merge paths that are close enough (aka pen diameter) to eliminate pen-up -> no-move -> pen-down movements
- output scale / simplify tolerance
  - visual display of scale
  - ui-controls for scale(or output-dim respectively)
  - ui-controls for simplification
  - data-structures to have original data and the ability to change ui on the fly

- acceleration-calculation / acceleration diagram
  - connect preview and chart so that mouseover on either element visually indicates the same assets in the other element

- speed indication on preview
