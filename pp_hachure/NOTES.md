Have a stepper control

1. pick and upload raster (check if pp_client code upload_svg can be reused)
2. show sample range and allow the user to enter unscaled range values, cellsize, raster origin
   - have a svg preview of the bounding frame once there is enough information (origin, cellsize, image)
