# PENPLOTTER.01

This is a free-time project that i have been working on for a while.

Intent is to use the low-cost Arduino CNC-shield in combination with an Arduino R4 WiFi, rather than the typical "Arduino R3 / GRBL" combination. I will try to take inspiration from GRBL and FluidNC and produce generic code suitable for my machine rather than a generic framework.

Currently the repo is mostly for backup purposes, but as the state of the project moves towards complete it may also be helpful to others.
